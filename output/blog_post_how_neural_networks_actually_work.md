## Breaking Down Complex Concepts with Stick Figures and Analogies

So you want to understand How Neural Networks Actually Work...

## Introduction

So here's the thing about How Neural Networks Actually Work - it's one of those concepts that seems simple on the surface but is actually mind-bendingly complex when you dig deeper. Kind of like asking "what is consciousness?" or "why do hot dogs come in packs of 10 but buns come in packs of 8?"

## The Basics

Let me start with what we know...

06 October 2021Link copiedWhat is a neural network A neural network is amachine learningprogram, or model, that makes decisions in a manner similar to the human brain, by using processes that mimic the way biological neurons work together to identify phenomena, weigh options and arrive at conclusions Every neural network consists of layers of nodes or artificial neurons, an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer

## Going Deeper

Now here's where it gets interesting...
